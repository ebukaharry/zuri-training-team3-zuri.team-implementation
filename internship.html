    <h3>ABOUT ZURI INTERNSHIP</h3>
    <h4>Zuri Internship runs internships that are designed to surface the very best of candidates out of a large pool of participants.
    </h4>

            <h2>How the program runs</h2>
        <p>There are 10 stages, you are required to complete all the 10 stages (which becomes increasingly more difficult as you go higher), after which you become Finalist. Being a finalist is a mark of honour - it shows that you have grit, perseverance, and can solve various problems successfully. <br><br>
            
            The program is designed to surface the very best of candidates - that means that even though an unlimited number of people can start, only a small percentage of those who start will complete the program. Typically, this is less than 10%. <br><br>
            
            A finalist is someone we can firmly recommend to any company for employment - because they have shown that they have what it takes.</p>

            <h2>Who Should Apply</h2>
            <p>Each Internship cohort is slightly different, even though we follow the same basic pattern. The current iteration is a follow-on phase for the ZurixIngressive Training, as well as the Reskill Americans training. It is open to everyone to join, but requires a bit of pre-knowledge. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have prior coding or design skills / knowledge</li>
                    <li>If you are a professional looking to connect with others</li>
                    <li> If you are looking for a challenge</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
               <p>The internship is a fun-filled experience that runs like a game, join us, and we promise you'll come out better, even if you're unable to complete the program.</p></p>

            <h2>Grow your portfolio</h2>
                    <p>We allow anybody and everybody to enter the workspace. The workspace will have more than 10,000 people active in it at the beginning. There are 10 stages - and as you progress, those who do not make it through are removed from the workspace.
                        The first three stages are a basic filter stage. <br><br>
                        You will be given tasks that are more focused with real world experiences. They typically involve a real world task which aims at identifying the most committed/driven interns and helping them harness their skills better. <br><br>
                        We also give rewards as you deliver on tasks. Rewards are usually in difference forms including cash and premium courses.</p>
